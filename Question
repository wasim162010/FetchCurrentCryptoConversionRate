Imagine you're working in an elevator company and you are asked to improve the elevator experience. Existing elevators find the shortest path to serve the passenger given a button input. It hasn't changed for more than 50 years. Now with advancement in technology, we have cameras at every level telling us how many people are waiting, how long each person have waited, and how many people are already in the lift. Describe how you would design a solution to best serve the passengers. No code needed.
